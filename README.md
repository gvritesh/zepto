This project focuses on creating a model to predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) using data from the Zepto platform over a 90-day period, with the goal of ranking products by their CTR. The dataset contains information such as search queries, city identifiers, product details, and historical performance metrics. We began by conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships, which informed our feature engineering process. This involved refining and improving features to enhance predictive accuracy. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we developed a model to rank products at the city level based on predicted CTR, using various metrics to evaluate and monitor performance. This comprehensive methodology aims to optimize sponsored search results through advanced data analysis and feature engineering techniques.
